Collect the internal nodes of a binary tree in a list

An internal node of a binary tree has either one or two non-empty
successors. Write a predicate internals/2 to collect them in a list.

Example:

% internals(T,S) :- S is the list of internal nodes of the binary tree T.

Example in Haskell:

Prelude>internals tree4
Prelude>[1,2]
