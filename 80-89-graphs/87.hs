Problem 87

(**) Depth-first order graph traversal (alternative solution)

Write a predicate that generates a depth-first order graph traversal
sequence. The starting point should be specified, and the output
should be a list of nodes that are reachable from this starting point
(in depth-first order).

Example:

<example in lisp>
