Problem 83

(**) Construct all spanning trees

Write a predicate s_tree(Graph,Tree) to construct (by backtracking)
all spanning trees of a given graph. With this predicate, find out how
many spanning trees there are for the graph depicted to the left. The
data of this example graph can be found in the file p83.dat. When you
have a correct solution for the s_tree/2 predicate, use it to define
two other useful predicates: is_tree(Graph) and
is_connected(Graph). Both are five-minutes tasks!

Example:

<example in lisp>

Example in Haskell:

length $ spantree k4
16
