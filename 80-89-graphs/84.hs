Problem 84

(**) Construct the minimal spanning tree

Write a predicate ms_tree(Graph,Tree,Sum) to construct the minimal
spanning tree of a given labelled graph. Hint: Use the algorithm of
Prim. A small modification of the solution of P83 does the trick. The
data of the example graph to the right can be found in the file
p84.dat.

Example:
