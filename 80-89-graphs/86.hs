Problem 86

(**) Node degree and graph coloration

a) Write a predicate degree(Graph,Node,Deg) that determines the degree
of a given node.

b) Write a predicate that generates a list of all nodes of a graph
sorted according to decreasing degree.

c) Use Welch-Powell's algorithm to paint the nodes of a graph in such
a way that adjacent nodes have different colors.
